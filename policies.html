      <div class="card reveal" data-delay="0.25s">
        <p>
          We expect our pupils and students to respect themselves and other people at all times. They must remember they are
          ambassadors of Woodland Hills and so are obliged to be of good, sensible behaviour both in and outside the school premises.
          Students are expected to greet staff with their titles and names while all visitors must be addressed as "Sir" or "Ma".
          No student should be involved in any matter involving money.
        </p>
        <p>Bullying in any form will not be tolerated.</p>
        <p>
          The use of mobile phones, iPods, laptops and other non-academic electronic devices is not allowed. Cheating during tests,
          assignments, homework, project or examination is prohibited. Offenders shall be punished.
        </p>
        <p>
          Disciplinary measures which are mainly detentions and in more serious cases suspension will be a way of reinforcing
          the discipline expected.
